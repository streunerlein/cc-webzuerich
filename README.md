# cc-webzuerich

Let's work out a code of conduct suitable for Webzuerich in a first phase *together*.

## How

This is a git repository, so I am sure you know how. But if not, my proposal would be 

 - Fork the repository
 - Edit the CC in code-of-conduct.md
 - Commit/Push your changes
 - Submit a pull request to this repository
   - state why you think your changes are necessary in the PR description
   - further discussion can happen in the PR
